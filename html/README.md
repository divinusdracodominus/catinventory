# Backend to CAT Inventory

## Files of importance

### additem.php
This handles response to post requests to add items to the data table that stores data about inventory entires

### post.php
This system is currently a theoretical means of handling user login and validation, and is from an old code base of mine, however this is likely not what will be used because central authentication service (CAS) makes more sense for this project

### laodtest.php
This file is responsible for showing everything in the table, and is used both for simple search as well as for dumptable features on the web frontend
